# Wine Quality Prediction
## Overview
Welcome to the "Wine Quality Prediction" project! This repository contains Python code and Jupyter notebooks for building a machine learning model to predict the quality of wines based on various physicochemical properties. The project aims to analyze the relationships between different features and the wine quality, and then use this analysis to develop an accurate predictive model.

## Problem Statement
The main objective of this project is to develop a regression model that can predict the quality of wines based on a set of input features. The dataset used for training contains a collection of red and white wine samples along with their respective quality ratings, which range from 1 (lowest) to 10 (highest). The model will learn from this labeled data to predict the quality of new, unseen wines.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises a combination of red and white wine samples. Each sample is characterized by several physicochemical properties, such as acidity, residual sugar, alcohol content, and more. Additionally, the quality of each wine sample is provided as the target variable for the regression model.

## Goals
The main goals of this project are as follows:

Data Exploration: Perform a comprehensive exploration of the dataset to understand the distribution of features and the relationship between predictors and the target variable.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, remove outliers, and scale the features as necessary for model training.
Feature Engineering: Select relevant features, create new features if needed, and identify feature importance for model performance.
Model Building: Implement regression algorithms, such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting, to create the wine quality prediction model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the regression model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2).
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model by tuning hyperparameters to improve predictive accuracy.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict the quality of wines outside the training dataset.
Project Structure

Usage
To run the wine quality prediction model on the provided dataset, you will need Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the requirements.txt file:

## bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
After installing the required libraries, you can use the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to explore the data, preprocess it, build the regression model, and evaluate its performance.
